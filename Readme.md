# CS229 Solutions in Python

Here we provide Jupyter notebooks of solutions to all the coding exercises from
the 2018 version of Stanford's CS229 course: Introduction to Machine Learning.
All of the notebooks are self-contained in the sense that the complete
statement of the question is given along with a brief discussion of the
context. Thus, access to the original problem sheets is not required.
For all questions (except spam classification) we also provide a
dataset or simulate one from scratch.
In most of the questions we also compare the performance of our implementations
with those from `sklearn`.

It is recommended to view the notebooks with
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) (links are provided below).

## Problem Sheet 1
